# Robot-Simulation

Stand-up:
Finished Parts:
1. Backend functionality is complete.
2. The architecture is built, keeping SOLID principles in mind.
3. Frontend functionality is also complete.
4. Centralized exception handler is used for exceptions

Next steps: (Some of them have been implemented in another branch feature/TS-Improvements)
1. Separate the command parsing functionality to improve code maintainability.
2. Implement system-wide configurations for CORS.
3. Implement logging for issues.
4. Utilize property files to remove hardcoded variables from the code.
5. Use separate exception classes for different types of exceptions.
