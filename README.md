# Robot-Simulation

Stand-up:
Finished Parts:
1. Main backend functionality is complete.
2. Solution of the assignment is designed by keeping SOLID and design principles in mind.
3. Main frontend functionality is also complete.
4. Centralized exception handler is used for exceptions.

Next steps: (Some of them have been implemented in another branch feature/TS-Improvements)
1. Separate the command parsing functionality to improve code maintainability.
2. Implement system-wide configurations for CORS.
3. Implement logging for issues.
4. Utilize property files to remove hardcoded variables from the code.
5. Create a separate messages file to store all messages so that they can be changed without changing code
